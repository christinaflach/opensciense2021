                                The Open Science movement is spreading all over the world. Its goal is to allow that researchers anywhere (and anywhen) collaborate through sharing their research outcomes -- such as data, software, models or publications. Though this definition is easy to understand, its implementation faces many challenges at all levels - from scientific policies to e-infrastructures and computational implementations. Open Science practices have become the norm (and even compulsory) in very many countries and, moreover, required upon submission of research proposals to funders.  The talk will give an overview of the Open Science movement based on Unesco's may 2021 draft, and discuss how researchers in Computing can contribute to allow the implementation of this movement in practice.

								<b>Short Bio:</b> Claudia Bauzer Medeiros (PhD Computer Science - University of Waterloo, Canada) is full professor of the Institute of Computing, Unicamp. Her research is centered on the management of scientific data, in particular the challenges associated with data heterogeneity, volume and complexity, for several real world applications. She was president of the Brazilian Computer Society from 2003 to 2007, and member of many panels and committees, including CNPq and CAPES. She is currently a member of FAPESP~s coordination of the program in eScience and data science, where she coordinates initiatives towards open data policies. She holds several Brazilian and national awards for teaching, research, and initiatives to attract women to computing. She is member of the councils of the ACM, RDA and ACS. Member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and the  World Academy of Sciences.

                                Papers are more and more paired with source code and experiment results to make research more open and more reproducible. This openness brings new challenges for the reviewers and also to the authors. The authors have to make their artifacts double-blind and the reviewers need to handle new external resources during the reviewing process. In this talk, I will discuss those challenges and present Anonymous GitHub, which aims to simplify the anonymization of repositories for authors.
